# Boiler: A Starter Module for Drupal

This is an example module with code ideas, tips and tricks to be used as a boilerplate codebase for starting your own modules in Drupal 7. Do not this module on its own.

## Install

Install as usual.

1.  Place boiler in `/sites/yoursitename/modules/custom/`
1.  Change the folder name and **all** function names and file names to the name of your module. Example: `function boiler_permission() {...} --> function my_module_name_permission() {...}`
1.  Get started coding, and enable your new module! :smile:
